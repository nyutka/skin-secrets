										<h2> Our Client Testimonials</h2>
										<p>&#8220;Lana, you have changed my life for the better. After trying Botox and
											Juvederm I realized this was just a &#8220;quick fix&#8221;. Your
											recommendation of Pixel Skin Resurfacing and Microdermabrasion has truly
											changed my skin for the better. Not only did you address my skin issues,
											you&#8217;ve also educated me on life style changes that starts from the
											inside. The information has changed my overall well being and am so thankful
											to you. Thank you so much!&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Sandy Risner, Dansville
												MI</strong></p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<hr />
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>&#8220;After my first visit to Svetlana&#8217;s office I got rid of all the
											face creams I had at home. For the first time after trying so many products
											and treatments I had someone who talked to me about the causes of skin
											problems, not just the symptoms! Now people say my skin is radiant.
											Svetlana&#8217;s professional guidance and knowledge has allowed me to
											finally stop worrying about how my skin looks. I can not express how
											thankful I am. I&#8217;m sharing my story so that others get the chance to
											meet with you, follow your instructions and finally get the skin they always
											wanted.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Kristina Pavirzyte, Chicago, IL</strong></p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<hr />
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so very happy with the Laser 360 you did for me. Not only
											did my skin texture improved but my lines and scars are almost totally gone.
											Your professionalism and expertise were superb. I would most definitely
											recommend you to my friends and family. Thank you for all you have done for
											me&#8221; &#8211; <strong>LaWayne Nappoles, Lansing, MI</strong></p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<hr />
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>&#8220;Thank you so much for your wonderful job. I really appreciate each
											session you did for me and love the results!&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Banin
												Jafar, Lansing, MI</strong></p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<hr />
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>&#8220;Lana &#8211; I want to thank you for your advice and hard work. You
											have changed my life for the better and I feel healthier than ever! You will
											be seeing me again for your wonderful service.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Amber,
												Birmingham, MI</strong></p>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<hr />
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p>&#8220;I always suffered from problematic skin and like many others, tried
											all the products that are advertised on TV like Proactive and SkinID. Some
											times I&#8217;d get a mild improvement but I was never really satisfied.
											Once I met Svetlana I never spent money in those products again and my skin
											is totally different. I follow her instructions and I have been able to stop
											wearing make-up during the day, which is something I was never able to do
											before. My tone is much more even, my pores look smaller and my skin looks
											much clearer. I highly recommend her to anybody who is suffering from skin
											conditions and has not been able to get long-term improvement. &#8211;
