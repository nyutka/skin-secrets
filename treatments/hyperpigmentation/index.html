										<p><strong>Hyperpigmentation, Discoloration, B</strong><strong>rown Spots, Age
												Spots</strong> are the main complaints for which people seek out
											cosmetic procedures.</p>
										<p>Hyperpigmentation is the darkening of an area of the skin caused by an
											increase in melanin. Hyperpigmentation can be genetic, hormonal, heat
											/chemical/ friction (usually a post inflammatory response), or
											environmentally based (sun or photodamage).</p>
										<p>There are various forms of hyperpigmentation.</p>
										<p><strong>Age Spots</strong> (also referred to as &#8220;sun&#8221; or
											&#8220;liver&#8221; spots) are formally termed
											&#8220;<strong>lentigines</strong>&#8220;. They are small, flat, round spots
											on the skin that begin to appear later in life in sun-exposed areas and are
											usually found on older adults on the arms, face, neck and back of the hands
											or other areas frequently exposed to the sun. A single spot is reffered to
											as a lentigo.</p>
										<p><strong>Solar Lentigines</strong> &#8211; sun spots and dark freckles appear
											to the sun.</p>

										<p><strong>Melasma</strong> (sometimes also called <strong>Chloasma</strong>) is
											similar in appearance to age spots but darkens larger areas of skin. The
											actual cause of melasma is unknown, but it is known to be related to both
											hormonal levels and exposure to sunlight.</p>
										<p>Pregnancy, for example, can trigger overproduction of
											<strong>melanin</strong>, causing the &#8220;mask of pregnancy&#8221; on the
											face (cheeks, forehead, or temples) and darkened skin on the abdomen and
											other areas.</p>
										<p>This type of hyperpigmentation can be hereditary, or triggered by hormonal
											changes. Women who take birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy
											may also develop hyperpigmentation because their bodies undergo similar kind
											of hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy. If treatment is stopped it
											will return.</p>
										<p>The lighter it appears the deeper it is and the longer it takes to treat.</p>

										<p><strong>Freckles</strong> &#8211; light brown small flat spots that appear on
											cheeks and nose. Freckles are thought to develop as a result of a
											combination of genetic tendency and sun exposure. They are usually present
											when young and get more with ageing.</p>
										<p><strong>Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation</strong> &#8211; is light in
											color, deep in the dermis. Some causes of post-inflammatory
											hyperpigmentation: acne, rashes like psoriasis and eczema, burns, irritation
											from shaving, plucking, ingrown hairs, waxing and electrolysis.</p>
										<p><strong>Brown Spots and Hyperpigmentation</strong> &#8211; reduction
											treatments are more difficult and not always satisfactory.</p>
										<h2>What cause Hyperpigmentation?</h2>
										<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2643 size-full"
												src={{ "/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/melanin_0.jpg" | relative_url }} width="325" height="274"
												sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" />Your skin is made of two
											primary layers; the epidermis is the surface, and the dermis lies beneath
											it. Located near the base of the epidermis are specialized cells, called
											melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin.</p>
										<p>Melanin gives your skin its normal color, and it is transported into new skin
											cells where it serves a protective role by absorbing harmful rays of
											sunlight that would otherwise damage the cells.</p>
										<p>The body actually produces extra melanin in response to sun exposure, and
											this is why you tan in the sun. However, after years of sun exposure,
											melanocytes in certain areas of the skin may overproduce melanin. As
											accumulating melanin gradually becomes more visible, an brown spots
											develops.</p>
										<p>Genetics also influences how likely a person is to develop age spots.</p>
										<p>It would be your responsibility for controlling and preventing
											hyperpigmentation, brown spots, age spots, freckles by avoiding unneccessary
											sun exposure and applying sunblock with SPF 15 or more.</p>
										<p>Several safe and effective treatments are available to help lighten or reduce
											the appearance of discolorations. Frequently, multiple or a combination of
											treatments may be required for best results.</p>
										<p>Not everyone&#8217;s skin will improve with similar treatments and brown
											spots can easily recur with repeated unprotected UV exposure.</p>
										<p>With any treatment of pigmentation problems, sun exposure MUST be avoided. To
											maintain results from a treatment and to prevent any further pigmentation
											damage from occurring, use of a physical block sunscreen with SPF of 15 or
											higher is mandatory. Also, maintenance treatments of the variouse therapies
											may be necessary.</p>
										<p>It is very important to have any spots checked by a dermatologist to ensure
											they are harmless prior to seeking treatment for age spots.</p>
										<p>During the consultation your practitioner at Svetlana&#8217;s Skin Secrets
											will be able to determine the best plan of treatment for your pigmentation
											problems.</p>
