										<h2>Excessive Sun Exposure and Aging</h2>
										<p>Basking in the warm glow of the sun can make us feel good, and in the short
											term, makes us look good. But excessive sun exposure at the beach or in
											tanning salons causes the majority of the <strong>sun damage</strong> that
											is associated with <strong>premature aging</strong>.</p>
										<p>This sun damage accumulates over time and causes cosmetic defects such as
											uneven <strong>pigmentation (age spots, solar lentigines, melasma)</strong>
											and more serious problems like skin <strong>cancer</strong>.</p>
										<p>The sun also causes the dilation of the <strong>facial blood vessels</strong>
											giving skin a mottled, <strong>reddish appearance, aging</strong>, collagen
											and elastin deterioration.</p>

										<p><strong>Aging</strong> of the skin is a process influenced by many different
											factors, including heredity, sun exposure, the environment, health habits,
											and general lifestyle. The sun and its ultraviolet (UV) rays have the
											greatest impact on how our skin ages.</p>
										<p>Approximately 80 to 85 percent of our aging is caused by the rays of the sun.
										</p>
										<p>As we age, the collagen and elastin fibers of the skin naturally weaken. This
											weakening happens at a much faster rate when the skin is frequently exposed
											to UV rays. The UV rays of the sun reach the skin in two different forms, as
											UVA and UVB rays.</p>
										<p>Each of the rays influences the skin at a different level.</p>
										<p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2655"
													src={{ "/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dansun.jpg" | relative_url }} alt="" width="176"
													height="176"
													sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" />UVA rays</strong>, also
											called the &#8220;aging rays&#8221;, contribute 90 to 95 percent of the
											sun&#8217;s ultraviolet rays that reach the earth&#8217;s surface. These
											rays weaken the skin&#8217;s collagen and elastin fibers, causing wrinkling
											and sagging in the tissues.</p>
										<p>UVB rays, also referred to as the &#8220;burning rays&#8221;, cause tanning
											of the skin by affecting the melanomas, the cells of the epidermis that are
											responsible for producing melanin. Melanin is designed to help protect the
											skin from the sun&#8217;s UV rays, but can be altered or destroyed when
											large, frequent doses of UV light are allowed to penetrate the skin.</p>
										<p>Although UVB penetration is not as deep as UVA, these rays are equally
											damaging to the sun and can damage the eyes as well. On a positive note, UVB
											rays contribute to the body&#8217;s synthesis of vitamin D and other
											important minerals.</p>
										<h2>Increasing The Sun&#8217;s Damaging Effects</h2>
										<p>Some people may be more at risk than others:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Where you live: If you live close to equator, the sun is directly
												overheard and the UV rays are stronger.</li>
											<li>How do you live: sun damage accumulates over time-the more you are
												exposed, the more damaged your skin becomes. Apply sun protection every
												time you venture out.</li>
											<li>You medications: certain medications, such as antibiotics, burth control
												peels, cause heightened sensitivity to the sun.</li>
											<li>Genetics: if you are fair skinned with light hair (red or blond) and
												freckles, you are at high risk of developing sun damage and skin cancer.
											</li>
											<li>Cosmetic Procedures: microdermabrasion, chemical peel, laser resurfacing
												can intensify your sensitivity to the sun.</li>
										</ol>
										<h2>Sun Damage Prevention</h2>
										<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2965"
												src={{ "/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/prot9.jpg" | relative_url }} alt="" width="272"
												height="185"
												sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px" /></p>
										<ol>
											<li>Protect yourself: Apply sun protection at least 30 SPF prior to every
												time you are going to be in direct or indirect contact with the
												sun.<br />
												<strong>Sun protectant ought to be applied to the face, ears, lips,
													neck, chest and arms. Do not forget to protect your scalp if you
													have bald spots or your hair is thinning. Put the protectant on 20
													minutes before you will be in UV contact. For extended or
													intentional exposure when you are working, exercising, or relaxing
													outdoors, sun protectant should be reapplied every 2 to 3
													hours.</strong></li>
											<li>Take cover: In order to minimize sun exposure, you should search for
												shade on every possible occasion. Firmly woven. loose-fitting,
												full-length clothing, and a wide-brimmed hat can offer additional
												protection. To help avoid damage to your eyes, sunglasses that block 99%
												to 100% of UV rays should be worn.</li>
											<li>Avoid the afternoon sun: UV rays are at its strongest between 10 am and
												4 pm.</li>
											<li>Oppose the temptation: Refuse to give in to the desire to tan outdoors
												in natural light or indoors under artificial UV light (sun beds). UV
												rays enter the inner layers of the skin. I reply, the body produces
												additional melanin, that causes the skin to be obviously darker. A tan
												is proof that UV has damaged some of the skin&#8217;s cells that is not
												healthy or safe.</li>
											<li>Avoid exposing children younger than six months of age to the sun.</li>
											<li>Get expert advice: You should schedule regular appointments with your
												dermatologist for checkups of the skin, especially if any changes in
												coloration, size, or shape of mole are detected.</li>
										</ol>
